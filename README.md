As the title implies, this coding dojo has nothing to do with the all time classic mobile game snake.

## Chapter 1 - Let's get moving

Say you have a grid of valid spaces, and a nondescript blob resides at one of these spaces, as in the example below:

```
.....
.o...
.....
.....
.....
```

Given a single direction command, this amorphous blob moves one space in that direction. So give the direction `RIGHT` would result in the following grid:

```
.....
..o..
.....
.....
.....
```

Calculate the next states for the following examples:

```
Example 1
direction: LEFT
.....
..o..
.....
.....
.....
```
```
Example 2
direction: DOWN
.....
.....
.....
.o...
.....
```
```
Example 3
direction: UP
.....
.....
.....
.....
....o
```

## Chapter 2 - Trapped in an infinite hell

None of the above examples showed what happens if the blob moves of the edge of the available space. In this world the edges actually act as if wrapped on a sphere, so travelling off any of the edges causes the blob to wrap around to the opposite side!

For example going `LEFT` from this position:

```
.....
.....
.....
o....
.....
```
Results in the following:
```
.....
.....
.....
....o
.....
```

With this in mind, calculate the next states from the following examples:
```
Example 4
direction: UP
..o..
.....
.....
.....
.....
```
```
Example 5
direction: RIGHT
.....
.....
.....
....o
.....
```
```
Example 6
direction: DOWN
.....
.....
.....
.....
....o
```

## Chapter 3 - Forced to repeat

Being the almighty overlord of this world, you can decide to force this blob to move **multiple times in a row**.

For example given this list of directions and this starting state:
```
sirections: RIGHT,UP,LEFT,LEFT
.....
.....
.o...
.....
.....
```
The resulting state would be:
```
.....
o....
.....
.....
.....
```

With this in mind, calculate the next states from the following inputs:

```
Example 7
directions: RIGHT,RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN
..o..
.....
.....
.....
.....
```
```
Example 8
directions: LEFT,DOWN,LEFT,LEFT,UP,RIGHT
.....
.....
.....
....o
.....
```
```
Example 9
directions: RIGHT,DOWN,LEFT,UP,UP,LEFT
.....
.....
.....
.....
....o
```

## Chapter 4 - Feed me

I now introduce to you... a small `x`. If our little `o` here comes into contact with an `x` then they will **consume** it and grow into a bigger `O` - Wow!! Not only that but a small tail gets added too!

An example is shown below:
```
directions: RIGHT,RIGHT,RIGHT
initial state:
.....
.....
o.x..
.....
.....

after first RIGHT
.....
.....
.ox..
.....
.....

after second RIGHT
.....
.....
.oO..
.....
.....

after third RIGHT
.....
.....
..oO.
.....
.....
```

The second **piece** of this hungry boy always follows directly one space behind the first piece.

Using this knowledge work out the resulting states of the following few examples:

```
Example 10
directions: RIGHT,RIGHT,UP,UP,UP
.....
...x.
.....
.o...
.....
```
```
Example 11
directions: LEFT,DOWN,LEFT,DOWN,LEFT,UP
.....
....o
...x.
.....
.....
```
```
Example 12
directions: RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN,RIGHT,RIGHT,DOWN
...x.
.....
.....
..o..
.....
```

## Chapter 5 - Feed me more!!!

If this rambunctious little ball encounters more of these small `x`'s then it will continue growing longer and longer!!

```
directions: RIGHT,RIGHT,RIGHT,RIGHT
.....
.....
ox.x.
.....
.....

after first RIGHT:
.....
.....
oO.x.
.....
.....

after second RIGHT:
.....
.....
.oox.
.....
.....

after third RIGHT:
.....
.....
.ooO.
.....
.....

after fourth RIGHT:
.....
.....
..ooO
.....
.....
```

Notice how only it's **head** actually grows bigger, the other parts just get added on the end.

The same rules apply to each piece of this little guy, that is, they all follow exactly one behind the one in front, meaning if the blob turns it will create a corner trail, as in the following example:

```
directions:RIGHT,UP,UP,RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN
.....
.....
....x
ooO..
.....

after RIGHT
.....
.....
....x
.ooO.
.....

after UP
.....
.....
...Ox
..oo.
.....

after UP
.....
...O.
...ox
...o.
.....

after RIGHT
.....
...oO
...ox
.....
.....

after DOWN
.....
...oo
...oO
.....
.....

after DOWN
.....
...oo
....o
....O
.....
```

Calculate the resulting state from the following inputs:

```
Example 13
directions: RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN,LEFT,UP
.oO..
...x.
...x.
.....
.....
```
```
Example 14
directions: RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN,RIGHT,RIGHT,UP,RIGHT
.....
x...o
...x.
x.x..
.....
```
```
Example 15
directions: RIGHT,UP,RIGHT,RIGHT,UP,UP,RIGHT
...x.
.ox..
.ox..
.oooO
.....
```

## Chapter 6 - Stop feeding me, me!

As this blob gets bigger and bigger, it starts to take up more of the finite plane that it exists on, if it accidentally tries to consume part of itself then it ***DIES***.

For example, in the following instance the blob would die because it turns in on itself:

```
directions: DOWN,DOWN,LEFT,LEFT
.ooO.
.o...
.o...
.o.o.
.ooo.

after DOWN:
.ooo.
.o.O.
.o...
.o...
.ooo.

after DOWN:
.ooo.
.o.o.
.o.O.
.o...
.oo..

after LEFT:
.ooo.
.o.o.
.oOo.
.o...
.o...

after LEFT:
.ooo.
.o.o.
.Xoo.
.o...
.....
```

Return the state where the blob dies in each of the following examples (*if* it does die):

```
Example 16
directions: RIGHT,RIGHT,RIGHT,DOWN,LEFT,UP,UP
.....
oO.x.
o..x.
o....
o....
```
```
Example 17
directions: DOWN,RIGHT,DOWN,RIGHT,DOWN,RIGHT,UP,RIGHT,RIGHT,RIGHT
.xox.
x.x.x
.x.x.
x.x.x
.x.x.
```
```
Example 18
directions: DOWN,LEFT,DOWN,DOWN,RIGHT,RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN,RIGHT,RIGHT,UP,UP,LEFT
.o.x.
.ox..
.ox..
.ooox
...O.
```
